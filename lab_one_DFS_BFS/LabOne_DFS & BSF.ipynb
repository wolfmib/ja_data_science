    "The `dfs_maze_solver` function is designed to find a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a 2D maze. The maze is represented as a list of lists, where each sublist represents a row in the maze, and each element within a sublist represents a cell. In this representation, '0' denotes a passable cell, and '1' denotes an impassable wall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `rows, cols`: Determine the size of the maze.\n",
    "- `path`: Initialize an empty list that will record the path taken to reach the end.\n",
    "- `visited`: Initialize a set to keep track of visited cells to avoid cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `dfs` function is a nested helper function that performs the DFS algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The function takes two parameters, `r` and `c`, which represent the current row and column in the maze, respectively.\n",
    "- The function starts by checking whether the current cell is out of bounds, has been visited already, or is a wall. If any of these conditions is true, it returns `False`.\n",
    "- If the current cell is valid, it is added to both the `visited` set and the `path` list.\n",
    "- The base case checks if the current cell is the bottom-right corner of the maze (`rows - 1` and `cols - 1`). If we have reached this cell, we return `True` as we have found a path.\n",
    "- The function then recursively explores all four possible directions from the current cell: down, right, up, and left. The order of these directions can affect the actual path found but not the ability to find a path if one exists.\n",
    "- If none of these recursive calls return `True`, it means the current path did not lead to the exit, so the current cell is removed from the `path` list (backtracking), and the function returns `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the `dfs` function is called with the starting position (0, 0), and the `dfs_maze_solver` function returns the `path` list, which contains the sequence of coordinates from the start to the end of the maze, if such a path exists.\n"
